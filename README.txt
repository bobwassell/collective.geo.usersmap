Introduction
============

This package provides a map view that displays the location of the portal users.

When a user fills the 'location' property in its user profile, a simple view converts
this property in coordinates by collective.geo.geographer geocoder adapter and returns
a kml document with all users locations.



Dependencies
============

* Plone >= 4.x
* collective.geo.bundle
